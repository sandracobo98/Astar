# A-star algorithm implementation for finding the shortest route 

(MSc. Modelling for Science and Technology)

The aim of this project is the implementation of a pathfinding algorithm to solve an graph optimization problem. 

Concretly we optimize the best routefromo Basílica de Santa Maria del Mar (Plaça de Santa Maria) in Barcelona to La Giralda (Calle Mateos Gago) in Sevilla using the AStar algorithm.

# Program code

- read_write.c: It contains the code that read the spain.csv, save the information in the correspoding structure and write the binary file.
- Astar.c: It read the binary file and find the optimal path between our start and target node.
- my_functions.h: It contains the structures and the functions used
- logs_read_data.txt: The log file that contains extra information about the read and write process.
- logs_final_route.txt: The log file that contains extra information about the application of the Astar algorithm.
- solution.txt: The solution, the nodes visted to find the optimal path between the two nodes.

For further explanation, as function documentation or code understanding, see  inside the files comments.
